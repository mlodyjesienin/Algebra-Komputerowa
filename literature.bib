publisher = {Springer},
abstract = {This is a book about Grbner bases and their applications. It contains 3 chapters, 20 sections, 44 tutorials, 165 exercises, and numerous further amusements. It is going to help you bridge the gap between theoretical computer algebra and actual computation. We hope you will have as much fun reading it as the authors had writing it! From the reviews: "This is one of the most refreshing mathematical books I have ever held in my hands. This is academic teaching at its best;" (H.Stetter, IMN 2003) "Every paragraph of the book shows how much the authors have enjoyed translating into printed matter the outcome of a long, large, deep and personal relation with computationally oriented commutative algebra." (L.Gonzlez-Vega and T.Recio, ACM SIGSAM Bull. 2004) "Each section begins with a quotation and an overview in which "Italian imagination overtakes German rigor". These introductions and the following main bodies of each section are well written, engaging and often amusing. The book is a pleasure to read." (J.Little, Math. Reviews 2001)}
