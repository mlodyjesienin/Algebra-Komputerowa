year = {2000},
publisher = {Springer},
abstract = {This is a book about Grbner bases and their applications. It contains 3 chapters, 20 sections, 44 tutorials, 165 exercises, and numerous further amusements. It is going to help you bridge the gap between theoretical computer algebra and actual computation. We hope you will have as much fun reading it as the authors had writing it! From the reviews: "This is one of the most refreshing mathematical books I have ever held in my hands. This is academic teaching at its best;" (H.Stetter, IMN 2003) "Every paragraph of the book shows how much the authors have enjoyed translating into printed matter the outcome of a long, large, deep and personal relation with computationally oriented commutative algebra." (L.Gonzlez-Vega and T.Recio, ACM SIGSAM Bull. 2004) "Each section begins with a quotation and an overview in which "Italian imagination overtakes German rigor". These introductions and the following main bodies of each section are well written, engaging and often amusing. The book is a pleasure to read." (J.Little, Math. Reviews 2001)}

edition = {2nd},
abstract = {From the reviews of the first edition: "It is certainly no exaggeration to say that A Singular Introduction to Commutative Algebra aims to lead a further stage in the computational revolution in commutative algebra . Among the great strengths and most distinctive features is a new, completely unified treatment of the global and local theories. making it one of the most flexible and most efficient systems of its type....another strength of Greuel and Pfister's book is its breadth of coverage of theoretical topics in the portions of commutative algebra closest to algebraic geometry, with algorithmic treatments of almost every topic....Greuel and Pfister have written a distinctive and highly useful book that should be in the library of every commutative algebraist and algebraic geometer, expert and novice alike." J.B. Little, MAA, March 2004 The second edition is substantially enlarged by a chapter on Groebner bases in non-commtative rings, a chapter on characteristic and triangular sets with applications to primary decomposition and polynomial solving and an appendix on polynomial factorization including factorization over algebraic field extensions and absolute factorization, in the uni- and multivariate case.}
